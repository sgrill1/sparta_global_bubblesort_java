# sparta_global_bubblesort_java

Author: Sam Grill;
Project Start: 15/10/18

Brief: My first Java project, writing a bubble sort algorithm. 

Project Aims: Provide an introduction to working with Java and sorting algorithms. Later, I began looking at implementing an interface to allow me to use 
varaitions of the main bubble sort algorithms.

This was a preliminary project to the sparta_global_sort_manager project that can be found on my profile.
