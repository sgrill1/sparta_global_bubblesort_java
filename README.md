# Binary Search Algorithm
My first Java project, writing a bubble sort algorithm.

## Project Aims 
To introduce to working Java and sorting algorithms. This project was built using the maven quick-start archtype and was the first preliminary project to the Sort Manager project (https://github.com/sgrill1/SortManager).  

## How It Works
The Bubble Sort Algorithm compares adjacent elements in a collection and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It iterates through the collection (an array) until it is arranged from lowest to highest. This project looks at a regular bubble sort with the later addition of a reverse bubble sort for the purpose of demonstrating inheritence.
